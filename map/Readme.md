### D3.js Mapping Project

Mapping project with enhancements over course material:

* Selectable map projection!
* Zoom on mouse wheel scroll (over land, not ocean)
* Zoom on input range selector changes
* Panning when click, hold, move on land masses
* User selectable horizontal & vertical rotation
* User definable projection parallels on supported projections (i.e. Albers,...)
* Countries get outline on mouse & touch events (except Australia?!?)
* Tool tips on mouse & touch events
* Blue indicating ocean
