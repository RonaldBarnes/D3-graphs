### Scatter Plot

#### Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Plots methane vs COâ‚‚ emissions on Y and X axes.

Circles' colours indicate percentage of country's renewable energy sources.

Circles' radii increase with urbanization rates.


Of particular notice is the animated axes "tick" lines: dashed lines across
graph which shift as year selector changes.


TODO: Tool tip `<div>`s need to shift left or right depending on which half
of graph they're on. Some truncation occurs when year == 1972 and mouse hovers
over top-right circle (as one example).
