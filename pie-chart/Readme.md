### D3.js Pie Chart

As part of an Advanced Web Dev Boot Camp course at Udemy.com, we made a pie
chart.


Mine is enhanced with:
* responsive design
* a colour legend for the continents
* a label on the year input selector (range)
* transitions
* etc.

I did omit the central chart of births by quarter though.
